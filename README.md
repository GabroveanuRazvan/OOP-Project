# Description 
Personal project implemented for my OOP course.

Made in C++, using Cmake.

The motivation is to implement the logic of a flower marketplace app.

# Features and Used OOP Paradigms

- [X] **Encapsulation:** every variable of every class is private.
- [X] **Inheritance:** some of the classes are derived from other classes or interfaces(abstract classes).
- [X] **Multiple Inheritance:** as the project is implemented using C++, multiple inheritance is allowed.
- [X] **Polymorphism:** as there are multiple classes that are derived from a common interface, polymorphism
is needed so that multiple classes can be treated as objects of that common interface. In the project there are
multiple "flower" classes implemented that extend a common class. Polymorphism can be used to store multiple objects
of different flower classes in a vector.
- [X] **Abstraction:** the classes represent real-world entities.]
- [X] **Design patterns:** design patterns like "factory" are used.
- [X] **Constructors/Destructors:** multiple types of constructors are used. The need for destructors comes from the use
of memory allocation and static variables within the classes.
